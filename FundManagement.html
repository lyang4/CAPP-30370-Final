<h1><a name="purpose">Statement of Purpose and Goals For the Student Investment Fund</a></h1>

<h2>Spring 2000 - Spring 2001</h2>

<h3>PURPOSE</h3>
<p>The CBA-ACIF was first established with a donation of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) by a member of the CBA
Advisory Council to serve as an opportunity for students interested in the securities markets to learn through practical experience.&nbsp;
Management of the fund is the principal activity of the Investment Club of Notre Dame.&nbsp;
The management structure of the fund is such that all members will have an opportunity to participate in the decision making process.&nbsp; Research teams, made up primarily of club members, will be responsible for monitoring
news and performance of assigned stocks, as well as providing market research and courses of action.&nbsp;
The results of this research will then be presented to the club members for discussion and recommendations.&nbsp;
The final decision for changes in the fund's portfolio will be made by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>
<h3>INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES</h3>
<h4>A. Rate of Return Requirements</h4>
This fund will be invested to maximize total return consistent with prudent risk limits
and adhering to the general investment philosophies and policies of the university. The
long- term annualized ROR objective for the total fund is inflation plus 6 percent.<br>
<br>
The total return strategy ensures that investment objectives will be met with the
intent of maximizing the long-term return of the entire portfolio, both from market value
increases (realized and unrealized capital appreciation) and from current yield (dividends
and interest).<br>

<h4>B. Risk Tolerance</h4>
The funds will be actively managed in a manner that will limit downside risk. The asset
allocation, investment structure, and guidelines are established to ensure adequate
diversification to reduce volatility.</p>
<br>

<h3>INVESTMENT POLICIES</h3>

<h4>A. Investment Constraints</h4>

      <ol>
        <li> <u> Time Horizon</u>:&nbsp; The investment horizon for this fund, in being consistent with the
University's endowment, will be in perpetuity.</li>
        <li> <u> Laws and Regulations</u>: The fund will be managed in accordance with the Prudent Man Rule
which is a flexible legal investment standard that allows the fund fiduciary to purchase
securities that a prudent man of discretion and intelligence would choose to earn a
reasonable income and preserve the principal.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
	  
<h4>B. Asset Allocations</h4>

        <li>U.S. Fixed income have a long-term target of 20% with an allowable range of 0-30%</li>
        <li>Global Fixed income have a long-term of 10% with an allowable range of
          0-10%</li>
      </ol>
      </p>
	  
<h4>C. Cash</h4>
Our long-term strategic target is 0% with an allowable short-term range of 0-10%.<br>

There shall be no more than 35% of the equity portion invested in a single industry.<br>
<br>
Investments in a single corporation should not comprise more than 20% of the portfolio.<br>
<br>
We will show an adverse inclination toward investing in low grade fixed income.<br>
<br>
The CBA-ACI fund will adhere to the standards and restrictions called for under the<br>
University of Notre Dame's Social Responsibility Policy.<br>
<br>
<h4>E. Benchmarks</h4>

<p>The fund will compare its performance to that of the market using such benchmarks as the S
&amp; P 500 or Dow-Jones Industrial Average for the equity portion and an appropriate
index the income portion of the portfolio in order to relate the funds return performance
to the market's performance.</p>
