  <h1>Our Mission</h1>
    <p>The club was established to serve as an opportunity for all undergraduate students, interested in the field of investments to develop and increase their knowledge of this important facet of finance through activities designed as rewarding educational experiences.</p>

  <h1>Club Profile</h1>
  <p>The Notre Dame Investment Club was first established with a donation of ten thousand dollars by a member of the CBA Advisory Council to serve as an opportunity for students interested in the securities markets to learn through practical experience.  Currently the club has an AUM of over half a million dollars through careful portfolio allocation. Management of the fund is the principal activity of the Investment Club of Notre Dame.  The management structure of the fund is such that all members will have an opportunity to participate in the decision making process.  Research teams, made up primarily of club members, will be responsible for monitoring news and performance of assigned stocks, as well as providing market research and courses of action.  The results of this research will then be presented to the club members for discussion and recommendations.  The final decision for changes in the fund's portfolio will be made by the Executive Committee. </p>
    
  <h1>Meeting Times</h1>
    <p>Weekly club meetings will on Wednesdays at 8pm. Meetings for each industry group will depend on the group leader.
    </p>
